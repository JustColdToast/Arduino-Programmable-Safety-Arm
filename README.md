# Arduino-Programmable-Safety-Arm
The software for a PIR, Servo, Potentiometer, and Arduino based robotic arm which reacts to proximety sensing of heat to provide autonomous safety functionality.
Included currently is only a software branch. Within it there are three different version, robotCodeV3 is the latest and most efficient version of the program.

The basic functions of the program can be tested at the following [link](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hKVaefZe7dy-psa-programmable-safety-arm/editel?sharecode=Ip9xPsaTkJJnUsFyGO4d6exGM3i6lTsaoV6gpvMoA3U).
This is a version of the PSA on TinkerCad, running the software provided, and allowing control of the servos and various buttons.
